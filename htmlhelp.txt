Semantics can be used a website, but are not often used. I think.
Semantic's:
    <section> = </section>                  --- Defines a section in a document. A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
    <article> = </article>                  --- Independent, self-contained content.
    <header> = </header>                    --- Introductory conetnt.
        A header usally contains: one or more <h1>. A logo or icon. Authorship information.
    <footer> = </footer>                    --- Defines a footer.
        A footer usally contains: Authorship information. Copyright information. Contact information. Sitemap. Back to top links. Related documents.

    <aside> = </aside>                      --- Content that is set aside from the main content. Like a complement to the main focus.
